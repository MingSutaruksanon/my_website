I start playing sport when I was a child. Swimming is my favorite activities. I join the swimming club and become an athlete to participate in several competition to strengthen my networks and improve both physical and mental health. I also enjoy eating and cooking, especially international cuisines. Cooking by myself is healthier and good time management as I can select high quality of ingredients and to organize the kitchen.
